**Info**
Hence Nukkit 2.0 will be renamed, this project it's going to be all rewrited and all the code has been published.
I am not sure if all code still works, try to compile it. What i know is the 2.0 branches are not full updated.

Welcome to use for resources :) But im sure it's easy to use factions-skyblock branches for 1.0

Note: Factions it's kinda messy at protection but its cool. Who can code can rewrite it.
